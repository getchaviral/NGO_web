Basti Ki Pathshala Foundation Website
Welcome to the Basti Ki Pathshala Foundation website! This is a simple, responsive single-page application built to showcase the foundation's mission and provide a platform for volunteers to get involved.

Key Features
Responsive Design: The website is designed to look great on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Single-Page Navigation: Users can smoothly navigate between the Home, About Us, and Volunteer sections without reloading the page.

Volunteer Form: A simple form to collect information from potential volunteers.

Custom Modal: A polished, in-app pop-up is used to provide feedback instead of a standard browser alert.

Tailored Content: All text content is specifically written to reflect the mission and story of the Basti Ki Pathshala Foundation.

Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface and managing component state.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.

Lucide React: A library of beautiful, open-source icons used for a clean and modern design.
